# RePack Learning Project

This repository is a part of my learning journey with **RePack**, focusing on optimizing React Native applications through code-splitting and modularization techniques. Currently, the project has a basic implementation of code-splitting, but more advanced features and materials will be added soon.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand and implement **code-splitting** in React Native using RePack, enabling modular and optimized app builds. With time, this project will incorporate additional functionalities, popular library features, and an automated CI/CD pipeline.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
- [Xcode (for iOS)](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

### Init

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aexomir/RePack.git
   cd RePack
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```
3. Running the Project
   You can run the project on iOS by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-ios
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

## To-Do List

## To-Do List

- [ ] **Module Federation**: Add modules to implement module federation, allowing remote module loading on public domains.
- [ ] **Library Integrations**: Add functionalities from popular libraries to enhance the app’s modularity and performance.
- [ ] **CI/CD Setup**: Integrate a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for streamlined builds and testing.
